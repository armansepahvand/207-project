        | Many years ago, as many of us do, I discovered my love of traveling.
        | I made a list of all the places I wanted to go to. I told my friends of my plans and they all were
        | excited.
        | Everyone wanted to go on trips together. As life would have it, one by one, each of my friends started
        | falling off the list.
        | And that was just for one trip.
        | So I decided to try it solo. I researched like crazy. I talked to so many travel companies. My travel
        | binder was
        | chaotic.

        |                 That was 10 years ago.

        |                 5 years ago, I started to blog my trips. It turns out, a lot of people wanted to know how they too could
        |                 travel solo.
        |                 My blogs became a website, my website became a company, and now we are a fully licensed travel agency.
        |                 If you have ever wanted to travel solo, but have no idea where to start, and/or feeling overwhelmed,
